No! It is reccomended to use the engine as is, as the engine comes with modding tools out of the box.

### The only reason you should think about compiling the engine is to make Feature Requests, fix bugs, and / or add features for your mod that Modding Tools can't provide (So you can add them yourself).
Otherwise you can just use the `./mods/` folder to make your mod!

The engine is basically similar to what you'd expect, but here are the immediate differences you will see.

## Options Menu
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; gap: 10px;">
    <img src="./Options Menu.png" alt="Options Menu" style="width:50%;">
    <img src="./Options - Gameplay.png" alt="Gameplay Menu" style="width:50%;">
</div>

Here you can see what the default menu looks like, and is formatted like a **Tree Menu**
#### TODO: Put a link here to learn more about how your mod can make custom Options with the XML, same for custom Controls.

### Controls Menu
<img src="./Options - Controls.png" alt="Control Options Substate" style="width:85%;">

### Developer Options

To start using Modding Tools, and shortcuts (seen in the Keybind Menu)
