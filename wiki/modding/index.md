# Modding The Engine - Softcoding
No matter what you do, editing the `./assets/` folder is not recommended, as it's used as your Backup folder / Mod if assets or data cannot be found, it will use the `./assets/` as a saftey catch. You should only make `Mods` in the `./mods/` folder.

There is also an `./addons/` folder which is somewhat similar to the way `./mods/` works, but it has it's own set of rules and best practices to follow.
#### TODO: Add a link to know how to make an Addon.

## THIS IS NOT A GUIDE FOR SOURCE MODDING!!
If you want to know how to make a Mod in Source, [TODO: Write a Doc.md for seting up a Source Project and link it from here!]

## <h2 id="folder-structure" sidebar="Folder Structure">How should I structure my folders</h2>

For starters, this is what an average Mod Folder will contain. We will go over some folders that require more explanation later.

#### NOTE!
This might not be EVERYTHING, but it's a good chunk of the folders Codename Engine interacts with.
</details>

Don't be scared by the amount of folders, usually you only mess with the `./songs/`, `./data/`, and `./images/` folders most of the time.
<br>It's good to have a reference of what you can do at least, so this will be updated from time to time with new updates (hopefully 😭).
