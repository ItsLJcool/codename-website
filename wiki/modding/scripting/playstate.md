title: Scripting - Interacting with PlayState
---

# TODO
Explain how PlayState handles scripts, and how to interact with them yourself in the Library heiarchy.

Explain as well that `PlayState Scripts` are a common phrase for identifying scripts running in the State itself.

You can also explain why you shouldn't really modify `PlayState` as a Custom State, since they are 2 seperate managers.
