title: Scripting - Custom States / SubStates

# TODO:
Explain how you can make a State / SubState in `data/states/` in your Library.

Explain how you can addon* to states from source. (Since you technically don't override them, you can execute code based on the state though).

Also explain how you can hot-reload States for efficent debugging and quick iteration.
