# Welcome to the Codename Engine Wiki
The wiki is here to document, explain, and to teach you a bit of knowledge about the engine!
### Navigation is done via this sidebar!

## ⚠️ CURRENTY UNDER CONSTRUCTION ⚠️
The wiki is still under a lot of restructuring, and reformatting how things are explained and presented. You might see a lot of unfinished pages, incomplete information, or a lack of information on a specific topic.

If you wish to help contribute to the wiki, please visit the <a href="https://github.com/CodenameCrew/codename-website">GitHub Repository</a> and contribute via pull requests.

Currently alot of the rework is being done on a Fork branch by ItsLJcool, you can find the GitHub Fork <a href="https://github.com/ItsLJcool/codename-website/tree/wiki-reformat">here</a>.
