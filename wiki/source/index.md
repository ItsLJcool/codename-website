# TODO
Write a comprehensive introduction of what you will need to make a mod using Source.

ALSO NOTE, PLEASE NOTE; that it is NOT recommended to make a mod directly in Source.<br>
List the pros / cons, and warn the user that source modding should be used in-tangen with Softcoding.

Also make a note for those who do publish their mod with source, they MUST open-source their code.

Also also, note that they should consider adding features like they would as a Pull Request to the Main Repository, for simplicity and possible implementation of said features!
